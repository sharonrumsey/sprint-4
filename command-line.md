Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay-person (e.g. your mum)
--I used the touch <filename> to create an empty file in the workspace/sprint-4  I use a sheet of command lines for reference and I know that there are other ways of creating an empty file using command lines.  To a lay-person I would tell them that some memorization would be necessary to learn to work in the command-line and that they should use them often to become familiarized with the usage of commands that are used 90% of the time.  So, imagine "touch" with it you create new "file".  And just associating it to that and of course having a sheet showing the usual commands helps as well.
This touch <file> will also update file access and modification time (from what I understand you can use this for time stamping to make sure that all files are included)

List 10 terminal commands and in plain English (i.e. with minimal technical jargon) describe what they do:
1. ls -a = list all files and folders (for the current directory)
2. ls -la  = list details of directory contents, including hidden files
3. cd = go to the root - which means taking you back to the beginning and then using the cd command again you can type cd <folder name> to move to that directory=folder name. It's good to do this at the beginning since it's easy to start work in the wrong directory (especially if you have many folders/directories).
4. mkdir = make a new directory or folder
5. git commit -m "message" = when staging a file to later push to the origin/master repo it's good to commit those stages periodically instead of just saving them to your local 
6. clear = clear your screen taking you to a prompt on the top command line
7. the TAB key = using it after typing in just a few characters will then populate the rest of the command that matches.  Such as typing in "wo" then hitting tab key will fill out the rest of "workspace".
8. The up or down arrow keys = will give your the commands that you have put in going backwards - you can keep hittin the arrow up key and not have to type previous commands put in during your session.
9. dir = list of directories
10. cd .. = navigate to the parent directory
